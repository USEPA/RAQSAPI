# Troubleshooting

In Functions that have the return_header=TRUE option set the returned object is
an AQSAPI_v2 object, this is a 2 item list where the first object is a tibble
with the label \$Header the second, a tibble with the label \$Data. sampledata
functions are limited by the API to one calendar year of data per API call so if
the user requests multiple years of data the sampledata call will return multiple
AQSAPI_v2 objects, one for each call to the API. The returned result is a list
of AQSAPI_v2 objects. In R to access the data in each item in the list the user
will need to use the "double bracket operator" ("[[", "]]") not the single
bracket operator ("[", "]").
