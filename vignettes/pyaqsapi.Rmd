## pyaqsapi - a port of RAQSAPI to the python 3 programming environment

For users that feel more comfortable working within a python 3 environment,
[pyaqsapi](https://github.com/USEPA/pyaqsapi) [@py3package:pyaqsapi],
a port of RAQSAPI to the python 3 language has been released. Both projects aim
to maintain feature parity with the other and there are no inherent advantages
to using either project over the other, except for the ability of working within
the programming language environment of choice. The API of both packages are
very structured similarly, both packages export the same data, use the same
credentials and data source to retrieve data.
