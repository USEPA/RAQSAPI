RAQSAPI functions are named according to the service and filter variables that are
available by the Data Mart
API.^[See (https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/documents/data_api.html) for the full 
details of the Data Mart API]

## Data Mart aggregate functions

These functions retrieve aggregated data from the Data Mart API and are grouped
by how each function aggregates the data. There are 7 different families of
related aggregate functions in which the AQS Data Mart API groups data.

**These seven families are**:

 1. **\_by_site**
 2. **\_by_county**
 3. **\_by_state**
 4. **\_by\_\<latitude/longitude bounding box\>** (_by_box)
 5. **\_by\_\<monitoring agency\>** (_by_MA)
 6. **\_by\_\<Primary Quality Assurance Organization\>** (_by_pqao)
 7. **\_by\_\<core based statistical area\>** (_by_cbsa).

Within these families of aggregated data functions there are functions that call
on the 11 different aggregate services that the Data Mart API provides.
**Note that not all aggregations are available for each service.**


**These eleven services are**:

 1. **Monitors** (*monitors_by_*) 
 2. **Sample Data** (*sampledata_by_*)
 3. **Daily Summary Data** (*dailydata_by_*) 
 4. **Annual Summary Data** (*annualdata_by_*) 
 5. **Quality Assurance - Blanks Data** (*qa_blanks_by_*) 
 6. **Quality Assurance - Collocated Assessments**
    (*qa_collocated_assessments_by_*)
 7. **Quality Assurance - Flow Rate verifications**
    (*qa_flowrateverification_by_*)
 8. **Quality Assurance - Flow Rate Audits** (*aqs_qa_flowrateaudit_by_*)
 9. **Quality Assurance - One Point Quality Control Raw Data**
    (*qa_one_point_qc_by_*)
 10. **Quality Assurance - PEP Audits** (*qa_pep_audit_by_*)
 11. **Transaction Sample - AQS Submission data in transaction Format (RD)**
     (*aqs_transactionsample_by_*)
     
| <span style="color:blue"> Information: AQS Data Mart API restricts the \
maximum amount of monitoring data to one full year of data per \
API call. These functions are able to return multiple years of data by \
making repeated calls to the API.  Each call to the Data Mart API will take \
time to complete. The more years of data being requested the longer RAQSAPI \
will take to return the results.</span> |

Aggregate functions are named AQS_API\<service\>\_\<aggregation\>() where
\<service\> is one of the 11 services listed above and \<aggregation\> is
either "_by_site", "_by_county", "_by_state", "_by_box", "_by_cbsa".
