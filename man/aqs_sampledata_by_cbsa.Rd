\usage{
aqs_sampledata_by_cbsa(
  parameter,
  bdate,
  edate,
  cbsa_code,
  cbdate = NA_Date_,
  cedate = NA_Date_,
  return_header = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{parameter}{a character list or a single character string
which represents the parameter code of the air
pollutant related to the data being requested.}

\item{bdate}{a R date object which represents that begin date of the data
selection. Only data on or after this date will be returned.}

\item{edate}{a R date object which represents that end date of the data
selection. Only data on or before this date will be returned.}

\item{cbsa_code}{a R character object which represents the 5 digit AQS Core
Based Statistical Area code (the same as the census code,
with leading zeros)}

\item{cbdate}{a R date object which represents a "beginning
date of last change" that indicates when the data was last
updated. cbdate is used to filter data based on the change
date. Only data that changed on or after this date will be
returned. This is an optional variable which defaults
to NA_Date_.}

\item{cedate}{a R date object which represents an "end
date of last change" that indicates when the data was last
updated. cedate is used to filter data based on the change
date. Only data that changed on or before this date will be
returned. This is an optional variable which defaults
to NA_Date_.}

\item{return_header}{If FALSE (default) only returns data requested.
If TRUE returns a AQSAPI_v2 object which is a two item
list that contains header information returned from
the API server mostly used for debugging purposes in
addition to the data requested.}
}
\value{
a tibble or an AQS_Data_Mart_APIv2 S3 object containing sample data
for all monitors matching cbsa_code for the given parameter. An
AQS_Data Mart_APIv2 is a 2 item named list in which the first item
/(/$Header/) is a tibble of header information from the AQS API and
the second item /(/$Data/) is a tibble of the data returned.
}
\description{
\lifecycle{stable}
Returns sample data where the data is aggregated at the Core
Based Statistical Area (cbsa) level. If return_header is
FALSE (default) this function returns a single dataframe with
the requested data. If return_header is TRUE returns a list
of AQSAPI_v2 objects where each index of the list is an
individual RAQSAPI_v2 object returned from each successive
call to the AQS API. RAQSAPI_v2 objects are two item list
where the $Data portion contains data that contains
sample air monitoring data at a site with the input
parameter and cbsa_code provided for
bdate - edate time frame. The $Header is a tibble of
header information from the API call /(useful for
debugging/). This function returns NULL is bdate > edate.
}
\note{
The AQS API only allows for a single year of sampledata to be retrieved
at a time. This function conveniently extracts date information from
the bdate and edate parameters then makes repeated calls to the
AQSAPI retrieving a maximum of one calendar year of data at a time.
Each calendar year of data requires a separate API call so multiple
years of data will require multiple API calls. As the number of years
of data being requested increases so does the length of time that it
will take to retrieve results. There is also a 5 second wait
time inserted between successive API calls to prevent overloading the
API server. Fortunately this operation has a linear run time
/(Big O notation: O/(n + 5 seconds/)/)
