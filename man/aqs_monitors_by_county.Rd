\arguments{
\item{parameter}{a character list or a single character string
which represents the parameter code of the air
pollutant related to the data being requested.}

\item{bdate}{a R date object which represents that begin date of the data
selection. Only data on or after this date will be returned.}

\item{edate}{a R date object which represents that end date of the data
selection. Only data on or before this date will be
returned.}

\item{stateFIPS}{a R character object which represents the 2 digit state
FIPS code (with leading zero) for the state being
requested. @seealso \code{\link[=aqs_states]{aqs_states()}} for the list of
available FIPS codes.}

\item{countycode}{a R character object which represents the 3 digit state
FIPS code for the county being requested (with leading
zero(s)). @seealso \code{\link[=aqs_counties_by_state]{aqs_counties_by_state()}} for the
list of available county codes for each state.}

\item{cbdate}{a R date object which represents a "beginning
date of last change" that indicates when the data was last
updated. cbdate is used to filter data based on the change
date. Only data that changed on or after this date will be
returned. This is an optional variable which defaults
to NA_Date_.}

\item{cedate}{a R date object which represents an "end
date of last change" that indicates when the data was last
updated. cedate is used to filter data based on the change
date. Only data that changed on or before this date will be
returned. This is an optional variable which defaults
to NA_Date_.}

\item{return_header}{If FALSE (default) only returns data requested.
If TRUE returns a AQSAPI_v2 object which is a two item
list that contains header information returned from
the API server mostly used for debugging purposes in
addition to the data requested.}
}
\value{
a tibble or an AQS_Data Mart_APIv2 S3 object of monitors from a
selected county
}
\description{
\lifecycle{stable}
Returns a table of monitors and related metadata at sites with the
provided parameter, stateFIPS and county_code for
bdate - edate time frame.
