  parameter,

\arguments{
\item{parameter}{a character list or a single character string
which represents the parameter code of the air
pollutant related to the data being requested.}

\item{bdate}{a R date object which represents that begin date of the data
selection. Only data on or after this date will be returned.}

\item{edate}{a R date object which represents that end date of the data
selection. Only data on or before this date will be returned.}

\item{stateFIPS}{a R character object which represents the 2 digit state
FIPS code (with leading zero) for the state being
requested. @seealso \code{\link[=aqs_states]{aqs_states()}} for the list of
available FIPS codes.}

\item{countycode}{a R character object which represents the 3 digit state
FIPS code for the county being requested (with leading
zero(s)). @seealso \code{\link[=aqs_counties_by_state]{aqs_counties_by_state()}} for the
list of available county codes for each state.}

\item{sitenum}{a R character object which represents the 4 digit site number
(with leading zeros) within the county and state being
requested.}

\item{cbdate}{a R date object which represents a "beginning
date of last change" that indicates when the data was last
updated. cbdate is used to filter data based on the change
date. Only data that changed on or after this date will be
returned. This is an optional variable which defaults
to NA_Date_.}

\item{cedate}{a R date object which represents an "end
date of last change" that indicates when the data was last
updated. cedate is used to filter data based on the change
date. Only data that changed on or before this date will be
returned. This is an optional variable which defaults
to NA_Date_.}

\item{return_header}{If FALSE (default) only returns data requested as a
single tibble. If TRUE returns a list of AQSAPI_v2
objects which is a two item list that contains header
information returned from the API server mostly used
for debugging purposes in addition to the data
requested.}
}
\value{
a tibble or an AQS_Data Mart_APIv2 S3 object containing annual
summary data for the sitenum, countycode and stateFIPS requested.
A AQS_Data Mart_APIv2 is a 2 item named list in which the first
item ($Header) is a tibble of header information from the AQS API
and the second item ($Data) is a tibble of the data returned.
}
\description{
\lifecycle{stable}
Returns multiple years of data where annual data is
aggregated at the site level. Returned is an annual summary
matching the input parameter, stateFIPS, county_code, and
sitenum provided for bdate - edate time frame. The data
returned is summarized at the annual level. Variables
returned include mean value, maxima, percentiles, and etc. If
return_header is FALSE (default) the object returned is a
tibble, if TRUE an AQS_API_v2 object.
}
\note{
The AQS API only allows for a single year of annualsummary to be
retrieved at a time. This function conveniently extracts date
information from the bdate and edate parameters then makes repeated
calls to the AQSAPI retrieving a maximum of one calendar year of data
at a time. Each calendar year of data requires a separate API call so
multiple years of data will require multiple API calls. As the number
of years of data being requested increases so does the length of time
that it will take to retrieve results. There is also a 5 second wait
time inserted between successive API calls to prevent overloading the
API server. This operation has a linear run time of
/(Big O notation: O/(n + 5 seconds/)/).

\examples{
# Returns a tibble of annual summary ozone
          #  data for the Millbrook School site (\#0014) in Wake County,
          #  NC for 2017 (Note, for annual data, only the
          #  year portion of the bdate and edate are used and only whole
          #  years of data are returned. For example, bdate = 2017-12-31 and
          #  edate = 2018-01-01 will return full data for 2017 and 2018 )
