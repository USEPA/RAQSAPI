\lifecycle{stable} AQS_DATAMART_APIv2
AQS_DATAMART_APIv2 is a relatively simple R S3 object composed of two
items, both of which are named lists. The first item, ($Header) in an
AQS_DATAMART_APIv2 object is a tibble which contains the header
information. The Header contains status information regarding the request
(success/fail), any applicable error messages returned from the API, if
any exist, the URL used in the request, a date and time stamp noting when
request was received and other useful information. The second item of an
AQS_DATAMART_APIv2 S3 object ($Data) is a tibble which contains the actual
data being requested.
