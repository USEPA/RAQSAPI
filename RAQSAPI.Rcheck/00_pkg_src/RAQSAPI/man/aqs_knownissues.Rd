\description{
\lifecycle{stable}
Returns a table of any known issues with system functionality
or the data. These are usually issues that have been
identified internally and will require some time to correct
in Data Mart or the API. This function implements a direct
API call to Data Mart and returns data directly from the API.
Issues returned via this function do not include any issues
from the RAQSAPI R package.
